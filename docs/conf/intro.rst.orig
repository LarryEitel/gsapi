Wellcome to gsapi
=================

gsapi comes with some tools for exposing your project's models via a
RESTful API.  There are several components to the ``rest`` module, but the basic
setup is to create an instance of :py:class:`RestAPI` and then register your
project's models with subclasses of :py:class:`RestResource`.

Each :py:class:`RestResource` you expose via the API will support, by default,
the following:

* `/api/<model name>/` -- GET and POST requests
* `/api/<model name>/<primary key>/` -- GET, PUT and DELETE requests

Also, you can filter results by columns on the model using django-style syntax,
for example:

* `/api/blog/?name=Some%20Blog`
* `/api/blog/?author__username=some_blogger`
