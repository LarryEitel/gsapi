                QUESTION: How to handle doc ListType fields that are embedded docs?
                    For example, client returns doc with list of embedded email docs. These need to be validated. # we can iterate over entire list in validation code
                    TODO: Pseudo code this process. Handle invalid embedded docs.
                    # Pseudo code for processing list of embedded email docs
                    # extract list emails embedded doc
                    # FUNCTION: controllers.app.extract_email
                    # iterate over emails list and validate
            Generate a new _id
                PROBLEM: Getting a new _id by creating a stub doc will be problematic in view of the fact that in some models there may be fields that have required values.
                    Solution? Maintain a set of _id's in a mongo.collection. Create a blank doc and grab the new OID. Use it to persist a new doc.
                FUNCTION: controllers.app.next_id
                NOTE: Use of _id. variableOID variable_id, variableId
                    _id is the name of the primary key field used by mongo. It represents the mongo document ObjectID.
                    If a field references an _id in another model, use field_id/attribute_id since it refers to an ObjectID value in another collection.
                    If a field contains the String value of an ObjectID, use fieldOID/attributeOID.
                    Python variables that are set to the value of an ObjectID are suggested to be named variableNameOID.
            Generate a unique numeric Id if implemented.
                Whenever Id or fieldId/attributeId is referenced, it refers to a unique numeric value similar to a RDBMS incremented primary key.

            Generate a unique slug.
                Create a slug using dNam. Must be unique for in model (_c) class. If proposed slug exists, increment from the trailing numeric portion occuring in proposed slug.
                Examples:
                    dNam: John Adams = slug: john_adams
                        if john_adams exists, slug = john_adams1
